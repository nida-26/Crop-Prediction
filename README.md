# Crop Yield Prediction Project

## Overview
The **Crop Yield Prediction Project** aims to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders by predicting crop yields based on various factors such as soil quality, weather conditions, and historical data. By leveraging data analysis and visualization, this project provides actionable insights to improve agricultural productivity and decision-making.

## Features
- Predict crop yield using historical and environmental data.
- Analyze the impact of weather, soil quality, and other factors on crop production.
- Visualize data trends and predictions using graphical tools.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Django (for backend development)
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning models, if applicable)
- **Database**: SQLite or any relational database

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-yield-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd crop-yield-prediction
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
6. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage
1. Upload the dataset containing environmental and historical data.
2. Choose the crop and input parameters such as weather conditions and soil properties.
3. View the predicted yield and analysis.

## Dataset
Ensure the dataset includes the following attributes:
- Weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, etc.)
- Soil properties (pH level, nutrient content, etc.)
- Historical crop yield data

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time weather data using APIs.
- Develop a mobile-friendly version of the application.
- Use advanced machine learning models for better prediction accuracy.
